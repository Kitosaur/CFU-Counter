# CFU-Counter
This Repository contains a basic imageJ compatible macro, designed to count the CFU's on an agar plate.

This ImageJ macro is designed to automate the process of counting colonies in plate images, regardless of their color or size. It handles varying image types by converting them to 8-bit and adjusting contrast for optimal processing. The macro is compatible with the ImageJ batch processing function, allowing users to process large sets of images simultaneously. However, due to the interactive nature of the code—particularly the user-defined selection and threshold adjustments—each image still requires separate input for accurate analysis.

The code can be downloaded as a '.ijm' file directly into the plugins folder of the Fiji distribution for imageJ2.
